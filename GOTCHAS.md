# FaithDock — Known Gotchas

Non-obvious things learned the hard way while working on this codebase. If you're picking this project up fresh — another Claude session, Claude Code, or a human — read this before touching auth, i18n, or the two-file deploy. Several of these took multiple wrong theories to actually diagnose; the goal here is to not repeat that.

## Deploy: two files, always together

`index.html` loads `pure-logic.js` via a relative `<script src="pure-logic.js">` tag. Both files must sit at the same root level on whatever's serving them.

This broke in production for real: manual zip uploads to Cloudflare Pages repeatedly included only `index.html`, so `pure-logic.js` 404'd — or fell through to SPA catch-all routing and came back as `index.html`'s content, which the browser correctly refused to execute as JavaScript (MIME type mismatch). `window.FaithDockPureLogic.computeWeekendRange()` — used by the "This weekend" events tab — would silently break with no visible error unless you specifically checked the console.

Now that Cloudflare Pages deploys from git, this specific failure mode should be closed — but if a "This weekend" bug ever shows up again, check that `pure-logic.js` is actually committed and present, first.

Also: Cloudflare Pages build config for this project should have **Build command** and **Build output directory** both **blank**. There's no build step — it's a plain static site with the real content sitting at the repo root.

## There are no `<form>` tags anywhere in this file

Every input is a bare `<input>` inside a `<div>`, submitted via a JS click handler, not real form submission. Zero `<form>` elements in the whole app.

Consequence: without `<form>` boundaries or explicit `autocomplete` attributes, browsers fall back to their own heuristics to guess which fields are "credential" fields — often based purely on DOM adjacency (a `type="password"` field sitting near a text/email field, no matter how it's actually used). Every password and email field now has an explicit `autocomplete` value (`current-password`, `new-password`, `email`, `name`, or `off`) specifically to stop browsers from guessing. **If you add a new password or email field anywhere, give it one too**, or this comes back.

---

## Hiding a wrapped password field needs more than `display:none`

`addPasswordToggles()` runs once at page load and wraps every `input[type="password"]` in a `.password-field-wrap` div, adding a `.password-toggle-btn` (eye icon) inside it, positioned `position:absolute; top:50%`.

If you ever need to hide one of these fields conditionally (e.g. the "Current password" field on Profile, hidden for Google-only accounts with no password set) — **setting `display:none` on the input alone is not enough.** The wrapping div has no explicit height, so it collapses to zero height when its only visible child disappears — but the toggle button is `position:absolute`, so it keeps rendering at `top:50%` of that now-empty box, which visually lands on whatever field comes next in the layout. This looked, for a while, like a browser extension or native browser autofill icon appearing on an unrelated field. It wasn't. It took inspecting the actual DOM element (not just theorizing about browser behavior) to find it.

**Use `setHiddenPasswordFieldVisible(inputEl, visible)`** (defined right after `addPasswordToggles()`) for any future show/hide toggle on a password field — it hides the wrapping div, not just the input, and also flips the input's own `type` attribute as a second layer of defense.

## JS can silently overwrite a correct translation

Several i18n bugs turned out to be: the static HTML had a perfectly correct `data-i18n="..."` attribute, but some JS function set that same element's `.textContent` with a **hardcoded English string** at runtime, after `applyTranslations()` had already run. Confirmed cases: the denomination dropdown label ("All selected" / "N selected"), the "N churches found" count, the pricing plan buttons, the account-type text ("Individual account" / "Church partner account"), the Church Home suffix, the password-label switching for Google-only accounts, and the delete-account warning message.

**`data-i18n` alone does not protect an element from being overwritten later.** Any JS that sets `.textContent` or `.innerHTML` on a translatable element needs to pull the string from `window.t('key')` at the exact point it's set — not rely on the one-time pass `applyTranslations()` does on load or language switch.

Rule of thumb: if a bug report is "this shows English even after switching to Spanish," check for a JS function setting that specific text dynamically before assuming the markup is missing `data-i18n`.

**Keep the two dictionaries in sync.** Both `translations.en` and `translations.es` should have exactly the same set of keys. Quick check:
```js
// paste into a node REPL after extracting the translations object
Object.keys(translations.en).sort().filter(k => !(k in translations.es))
Object.keys(translations.es).sort().filter(k => !(k in translations.en))
```
Both should return empty arrays. Run this after any batch of i18n edits.

## Post-login routing needs the actual intended destination, not a guess

`routeAfterLogin()` decides where to send someone right after they sign in. It used to compute a landing route purely from account type — platform admin → admin, owns/staffs a church → my-churches, brand-new OAuth signup → profile, else → home — with **zero memory of what page they were actually trying to reach** before getting bounced to the sign-up page.

Confirmed live, twice: someone hits `#profile` or `#dashboard` while signed out, gets redirected to sign-up, signs in, and lands somewhere else entirely — because `routeAfterLogin` never knew where they'd been headed in the first place.

Fix: `window.savePostLoginRoute(route)` / `window.consumePostLoginRoute()` use `sessionStorage`, not a plain JS variable — Google OAuth is a real full-page navigation away to accounts.google.com and back, so anything held only in memory is gone by the time the person returns. Call `savePostLoginRoute()` at the point of any "you're not signed in, redirecting to signup" guard; `routeAfterLogin()` checks for and prefers this over its own account-type guesswork.

This is **deliberately scoped to page-level redirects only** (Profile, Dashboard) — not to the many `showLoginRequired()` action-prompt modals (follow a church, join a group, register for an event, etc.), since those are action-based, not page-based, and resuming the underlying action after login is a separate, bigger feature nobody's built yet. Those modal buttons, and the plain nav "Log in"/"Sign up" links, explicitly call `window.clearStalePostLoginRoute()` — without that, an abandoned earlier attempt (got bounced toward Profile, gave up, came back later for something unrelated) could incorrectly resurface on a totally different sign-in.

## Multiple Turnstile widgets exist in the DOM simultaneously

This is an SPA — hidden page sections are never removed from the DOM, only toggled with CSS. That means the signup/login Turnstile widget and the two Profile-page widgets (email change, password change) can all be sitting in the DOM at once, even though only one is ever visible.

`turnstile.reset()` called with **no argument** is ambiguous once more than one widget exists. Every reset call in this codebase now targets a specific widget by ID: `turnstile.reset('#auth-turnstile')`, `turnstile.reset('#profile-email-turnstile')`, `turnstile.reset('#profile-password-turnstile')`. If you add a new Turnstile widget anywhere, give its container an explicit `id` and always reset it by that id.

---

## Plan naming has drifted before — check all four names

At one point the pricing page cards said "Medium"/"Large" while the button IDs, checkout logic (`startPlanCheckout('standard')`), and the dashboard billing section already said "Standard"/"Premium." If you're touching pricing or billing copy, grep for all four names (`Medium`, `Large`, `Standard`, `Premium`) to confirm nothing's drifted again — the rename doesn't always happen everywhere at once.

## Turnstile "flexible" sizing has a hard 300px floor — check your container width first

The auth card and the two Profile-page cards in this app have only **216px of actual content width** (confirmed via DevTools box-model inspection: 36px padding + 1px border on each side of a narrow mobile card). Cloudflare Turnstile's `data-size="flexible"` mode looks like the right answer for a narrow, variable-width container — it isn't, here, because it still enforces `min-width:300px` as a hard floor via inline style on the iframe itself. No external CSS can shrink it below that: `min-width` beats `max-width` when they conflict, and a plain (non-`!important`) inline style is still enough to win against a same-specificity external rule. Three separate attempts to fix this by overriding `overflow`, `padding`, and `max-width` on our own CSS all failed for this reason — none of them touched the actual constraint.

**`data-size="compact"` (150px wide, 140px tall — it stacks its content vertically instead of horizontally) is the only official Turnstile size that actually fits inside 216px without a fight.** All three Turnstile widgets in this app use it for that reason. Don't switch any of them back to `"flexible"` or `"normal"` (both effectively need ≥300px) without first confirming the container's actual content width in DevTools — not just eyeballing it, and not just trusting a percentage-based CSS value, since box-sizing and nested padding can make the real number surprisingly different from what the layout looks like it should provide.

If you're ever debugging a third-party embedded widget that won't respect a CSS override: check the element's actual inline style in DevTools before assuming your CSS specificity is the problem. `width`, `max-width`, and `min-width` can all be set independently by the same script, and only one of the three might actually be the binding constraint — overriding the wrong one (as happened here, twice) looks like it should work and does nothing.

## Working conventions worth restating

- **Bump the footer build stamp** (`build YYYY-MM-DD-vNNN`) after every round of changes — it's the fastest way to confirm whether what's live actually reflects the latest work, or whether a browser is just caching an old version.
- **Auth-related changes get live-tested with real console/DOM evidence before being trusted.** This file exists specifically because several bugs "looked safe on paper" — three separate wrong theories, in one case — before someone actually inspected the DOM or pasted a real console log and the true cause became obvious. Reasoning from the code alone was not enough for any of the bugs listed above.
- **New user-facing strings** need both English and Spanish dictionary entries plus a `data-i18n` attribute (or `data-i18n-placeholder` / `data-i18n-title` for non-text-content cases). Mixed-content elements — an icon next to text — need the text wrapped in its own `<span data-i18n="...">`, not left as loose text beside the icon.
- **Plan-gated features** follow one pattern: an inline locked/upsell panel in the UI, plus a matching server-side check at save time. Never just hide something in the UI and call it gated.
- **Theming:** `--brand` (fixed navy) for anything that must stay legible against gold; `--ink` (adaptive) for regular body text. Mixing these up is how buttons go invisible in dark mode.
